# ReapO
Intial MERN stack repo, (Marco's ultimately towards a full stack shift roster calender system)

Plan of attack

1) Get a good understading of React.js, Node.js and worry about Express & MongoDB later.
   1.1) Node.js a framework of JS, and is used for working with or building the backend of an application using JavaScript
   1.2) ReactJS is a JS front-end library, used for building UI or the frontend of an application.

2) Milestones will be updated as we learn along the way
   2.1) Get a webpage running locally - displaying interactive elements such as a calender, user forms (comments, posts), user profiles.
     2.1.1) Barebones HTML/CSS can suffice for now, basic logic of serving the webpage & its components to a user is priority.
     2.1.2) Define what types of users will using this system, Administrator, User and Viewer. And what they will be able to edit/request/view. 
     2.1.3) Three modes of views should be displayed, current on-shift (by site or assignee), holistic view that shows a chain of shifts                     (highlights any broken chains that require attention), 
   2.2) Authentication and hosting on cloud or server.
     2.21) User DB, Sessions/Instances keys, notification systems
